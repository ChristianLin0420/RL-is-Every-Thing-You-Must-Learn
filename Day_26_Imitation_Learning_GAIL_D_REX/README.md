# Day 26: Imitation Learning: GAIL & D-REX

## 🎯 Goal
Implement GAIL on MuJoCo demo dataset and compare to behavior cloning.

## 📋 Task
- Implement Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL)
- Collect or use expert demonstrations from MuJoCo environments
- Compare with Behavior Cloning and D-REX
- Analyze sample efficiency and performance vs expert data

## 🔑 Key Concepts
- **GAIL**: Adversarial learning to match expert state-action distribution
- **Discriminator**: Distinguish expert from agent trajectories
- **Behavior Cloning**: Direct supervised learning from expert actions
- **Distribution Matching**: Learn policy that generates expert-like behavior

## 📚 Learning Objectives
1. Understand imitation learning paradigms
2. Implement adversarial training for imitation
3. Compare different imitation learning approaches
4. Analyze expert data requirements and sample efficiency

## 🛠️ Implementation Guidelines
- Collect expert demonstrations or use existing datasets
- Implement discriminator network for trajectory classification
- Train policy generator adversarially against discriminator
- Compare with BC baseline and analyze performance gaps
