# Day 12: MuZero (Planning Without a Model)

## 🎯 Goal
Study MuZero's core ideas and implement basic components.

## 📋 Task
- Implement simplified MuZero with MCTS and value networks
- Build representation, dynamics, and prediction functions
- Test on simple board game or control task
- Compare with AlphaZero and model-free methods

## 🔑 Key Concepts
- **MuZero**: Model-based RL without explicit environment model
- **MCTS**: Monte Carlo Tree Search for planning
- **Representation Learning**: Learn state representations for planning
- **Recurrent Dynamics**: Predict next hidden states and rewards

## 📚 Learning Objectives
1. Understand MuZero's breakthrough in model-based RL
2. Implement MCTS with learned value and policy networks
3. Learn dynamics in hidden state space
4. Analyze planning quality and sample efficiency

## 🛠️ Implementation Guidelines
- Implement representation, dynamics, and prediction networks
- Use simplified MCTS for planning
- Test on Connect4 or CartPole environment
- Track MCTS statistics and planning performance
