# Day 11: Planning with Value Prediction Networks (VPN)

## 🎯 Goal
Understand value prediction vs model rollout and implement VPN.

## 📋 Task
- Implement Value Prediction Networks for planning
- Compare direct value prediction with model-based rollouts
- Test on navigation or control tasks
- Analyze computational efficiency vs accuracy tradeoffs

## 🔑 Key Concepts
- **VPN**: Direct prediction of future values without explicit dynamics
- **Planning Module**: Learn to look ahead multiple steps
- **Value Iteration Networks**: Differentiable planning in neural networks
- **Abstract Planning**: Planning in learned representations

## 📚 Learning Objectives
1. Understand alternatives to explicit dynamics models
2. Implement differentiable planning modules
3. Compare planning approaches and their efficiency
4. Analyze learned planning representations

## 🛠️ Implementation Guidelines
- Implement VPN architecture with planning module
- Use grid navigation or simple control environment
- Compare with model-free and model-based baselines
- Visualize learned planning trajectories
