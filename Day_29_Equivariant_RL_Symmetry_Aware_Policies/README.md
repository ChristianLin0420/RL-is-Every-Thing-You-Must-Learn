# Day 29: Equivariant RL & Symmetry-Aware Policies

## 🎯 Goal
Study how equivariant architectures improve sample efficiency in symmetric environments.

## 📋 Task
- Implement equivariant neural networks for RL
- Test on GridWorld with rotation/reflection symmetries
- Compare with standard CNN/MLP architectures
- Analyze sample efficiency gains from symmetry

## 🔑 Key Concepts
- **Equivariance**: Output transforms predictably with input transformations
- **Group Theory**: Mathematical framework for symmetries
- **Rotation Equivariance**: Networks that handle rotations naturally
- **Sample Efficiency**: Faster learning through symmetry constraints

## 📚 Learning Objectives
1. Understand symmetry in RL environments
2. Implement group-equivariant neural networks
3. Analyze sample efficiency benefits
4. Study different types of symmetries (rotation, translation, etc.)

## 🛠️ Implementation Guidelines
- Create GridWorld environment with rotation symmetry
- Implement rotation-equivariant CNN layers
- Compare with standard CNN on navigation tasks
- Measure sample efficiency and generalization
