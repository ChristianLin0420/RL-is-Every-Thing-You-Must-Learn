# Day 17: Multi-Agent Basics (Self-Play, Independent Learners)

## 🎯 Goal
Train independent DQNs in multi-agent gridworld environment.

## 📋 Task
- Implement multi-agent gridworld environment
- Train independent DQN agents (no communication)
- Implement self-play training paradigm
- Analyze emergent behaviors and Nash equilibria

## 🔑 Key Concepts
- **Multi-Agent RL**: Multiple learning agents in shared environment
- **Independent Learning**: Agents learn without considering others
- **Self-Play**: Agent trains against copies of itself
- **Non-Stationarity**: Environment changes as other agents learn

## 📚 Learning Objectives
1. Understand multi-agent learning challenges
2. Implement independent learning algorithms
3. Analyze convergence in multi-agent settings
4. Study emergent behaviors and cooperation/competition

## 🛠️ Implementation Guidelines
- Create simple multi-agent gridworld (2-4 agents)
- Implement independent DQN for each agent
- Add self-play mechanism for training
- Visualize agent policies and interactions
