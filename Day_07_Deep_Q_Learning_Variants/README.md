# Day 7: Deep Q-Learning & Variants

## 🎯 Goal
Implement DQN and its improvements on Atari games.

## 📋 Task
- Implement Deep Q-Network (DQN) with experience replay
- Add Double DQN to reduce overestimation bias
- Implement Dueling DQN architecture
- Test on Atari Pong environment

## 🔑 Key Concepts
- **Experience Replay**: Store and sample past experiences
- **Target Network**: Separate network for stable Q-targets
- **Double DQN**: Use online network for action selection, target for evaluation
- **Dueling Architecture**: Separate value and advantage streams

## 📚 Learning Objectives
1. Understand function approximation challenges in Q-learning
2. Implement experience replay and target networks
3. Compare DQN variants and their improvements
4. Handle high-dimensional state spaces (images)

## 🛠️ Implementation Guidelines
- Use CNN for Atari game states
- Implement replay buffer with priority sampling
- Add frame stacking and preprocessing
- Track Q-values and loss convergence
