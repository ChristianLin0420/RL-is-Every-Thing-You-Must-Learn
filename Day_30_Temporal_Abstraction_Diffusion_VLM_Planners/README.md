# Day 30: Temporal Abstraction via Diffusion or VLM Planners

## 🎯 Goal
Explore diffusion-based planners and VLA models for hierarchical planning.

## 📋 Task
- Implement diffusion-based planner for high-level action sequences
- Explore Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for robotic control
- Test temporal abstraction on manipulation or navigation tasks
- Compare with traditional hierarchical RL approaches

## 🔑 Key Concepts
- **Diffusion Policies**: Use diffusion models for action sequence generation
- **VLA Models**: Vision-Language-Action models for robotic control
- **Temporal Abstraction**: Planning at multiple time scales
- **Goal-Conditioned Planning**: Generate action sequences toward specific goals

## 📚 Learning Objectives
1. Understand modern approaches to temporal abstraction
2. Implement diffusion-based action planning
3. Explore multimodal planning with vision and language
4. Analyze benefits over traditional hierarchical methods

## 🛠️ Implementation Guidelines
- Implement simplified diffusion policy for action sequences
- Create goal-conditioned manipulation environment
- Use pretrained vision-language models if available
- Compare with option-critic and other hierarchical methods
