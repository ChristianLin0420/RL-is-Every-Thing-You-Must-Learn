# Day 22: RLHF (Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback)

## 🎯 Goal
Implement preference-based reward modeling and train policy via DPO or PPO.

## 📋 Task
- Implement reward model from human preference comparisons
- Train policy using PPO with learned reward model
- Compare with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)
- Analyze alignment between human preferences and learned behavior

## 🔑 Key Concepts
- **RLHF**: Learn from human preferences instead of reward signals
- **Preference Learning**: Train reward model on trajectory comparisons
- **DPO**: Direct policy optimization without explicit reward model
- **Alignment**: Ensure AI behavior matches human values

## 📚 Learning Objectives
1. Understand preference-based learning paradigms
2. Implement reward model training from comparisons
3. Compare RLHF with DPO approaches
4. Analyze human-AI alignment challenges

## 🛠️ Implementation Guidelines
- Create simple preference collection interface
- Train reward model on preference pairs
- Use learned rewards for PPO training
- Implement DPO as comparison baseline
