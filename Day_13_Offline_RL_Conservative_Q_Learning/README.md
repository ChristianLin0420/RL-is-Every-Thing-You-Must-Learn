# Day 13: Offline RL & Conservative Q-Learning (CQL)

## 🎯 Goal
Implement CQL on D4RL benchmark and understand offline RL challenges.

## 📋 Task
- Implement Conservative Q-Learning algorithm
- Test on D4RL HalfCheetah-medium dataset
- Compare with behavior cloning and standard Q-learning
- Analyze distribution shift and extrapolation errors

## 🔑 Key Concepts
- **Offline RL**: Learn from fixed datasets without environment interaction
- **CQL**: Conservative Q-function to avoid overestimation on unseen actions
- **Distribution Shift**: Gap between behavior policy and learned policy
- **D4RL**: Standardized offline RL benchmark datasets

## 📚 Learning Objectives
1. Understand challenges of offline reinforcement learning
2. Implement conservative value function estimation
3. Analyze distribution shift problems
4. Compare offline RL algorithms

## 🛠️ Implementation Guidelines
- Use D4RL dataset (install d4rl package)
- Implement CQL loss with lagrange multiplier
- Compare with AWR, BEAR, or IQL
- Analyze Q-value distributions and policy performance
