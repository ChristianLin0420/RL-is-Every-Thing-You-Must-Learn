# Day 19: Mean Field RL or MAPPO

## 🎯 Goal
Reproduce MAPPO on multi-agent MuJoCo or StarCraft micro-management.

## 📋 Task
- Implement Multi-Agent PPO with parameter sharing
- Test on multi-agent MuJoCo environment
- Compare with independent PPO and MADDPG
- Analyze scalability to large numbers of agents

## 🔑 Key Concepts
- **MAPPO**: Multi-agent extension of PPO
- **Parameter Sharing**: Share network parameters across agents
- **Centralized Value Function**: Global critic for all agents
- **Scalability**: Handle large numbers of agents efficiently

## 📚 Learning Objectives
1. Understand multi-agent policy gradient methods
2. Implement parameter sharing strategies
3. Analyze scalability benefits and limitations
4. Compare different multi-agent algorithms

## 🛠️ Implementation Guidelines
- Use multi-agent MuJoCo environments (e.g., HalfCheetah-v2)
- Implement shared actor-critic networks
- Use centralized training with decentralized execution
- Track scalability metrics with varying agent numbers
