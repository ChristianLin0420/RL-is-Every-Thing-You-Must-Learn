# Day 27: Causal RL & Generalization

## 🎯 Goal
Study causal MDPs and understand interventions in model-based RL.

## 📋 Task
- Implement causal discovery in RL environments
- Study interventional data vs observational data
- Test generalization across environments with different causal structures
- Analyze robustness to distribution shift

## 🔑 Key Concepts
- **Causal MDPs**: MDPs with explicit causal structure
- **Interventions**: Do-calculus and experimental manipulation
- **Confounders**: Hidden variables affecting both actions and outcomes
- **Causal Generalization**: Transfer learning via causal invariance

## 📚 Learning Objectives
1. Understand causal inference in RL
2. Implement causal discovery algorithms
3. Analyze interventional vs observational learning
4. Study generalization via causal invariance

## 🛠️ Implementation Guidelines
- Create environments with known causal structure
- Implement causal discovery methods (e.g., PC algorithm)
- Test transfer between environments with different confounders
- Analyze performance under distribution shift
